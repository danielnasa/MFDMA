# MFDMA
# Multiscale MFDMA method (MFDMAtau)

Several classical (multi)fractal methods (e.g., DFA and MFDFA) have been modified for the estimation of the temporal spectrum of scale exponents. These improved versions are used to better quantify the short- and long-range correlations, that is important in our case because multifractality arises mostly because of correlations. In spite of the large efforts undertaken, the methods have a strong dependence with window width and shift length of windows (slide length). Inspired by these studies and encouraged by the results and challenges, we decided to go further and calculate the time-dependent scaling exponent h(q).

We introduce a new approach here called the multiscale MFDMA method (MFDMAtau), which allows us to extend the investigation of stellar variability to include the dependence on the multiscale fluctuation of the variability analysing tau-nearest neighbours. MFDMAtau is relatively immune to additive noise and non-stationarity, including the nonstationarity due to inclusions into the time series of events of a different dynamics.

The presence of large-amplitude fluctuations in flux on a wide range of scales and the occurrence of many large abrupt jumps in flux are two interesting features of Kepler mission time series. In particular, the multiscale fluctuations can be described by the increments $\Delta x(t,\tau)=x(t+\tau)-x(t)$, where $\tau$ varies from 29.4 min (Kepler cadence) to $\sim$60 days. For further details, I recommend to see my paper: https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2021/06/aa40287-21/aa40287-21.html, where I applied this new approach to Kepler-30 data.

Just enjoy!!!!
