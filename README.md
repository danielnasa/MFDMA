# MFDMA
Multiscale MFDMA method (MFDMA$\tau$)}
Several authors \citep[e.g.,][]{gier,wang} have suggested that a single scaling exponent ($H(q=2)$) is inadequate to describe the internal dynamics of signals, and consequently, classical (multi)fractal methods (e.g., \textbf{\textit{DFA}} and \textbf{\textit{MFDFA}}) have been modified for the estimation of the temporal spectrum of scale exponents. These improved versions are used to better quantify the short- and long-range correlations, \textcolor{red}{that is important in our case because multifractality arises mostly because of correlations (cf. Sect. 4.2 and Table \ref{tab1})}. In spite of the large efforts undertaken, the methods have a strong dependence with window width and shift length of windows (slide length) \citep[for futher details about these parameters, see][]{wang}. Inspired by these studies and encouraged by the results and challenges, we decided to go further and calculate the time-dependent scaling exponent $h(q)$.

We introduce a new approach here called the multiscale MFDMA method (MFDMA$\tau$), which allows us to extend the investigation of stellar variability to include the dependence on the multiscale fluctuation of the variability analysing $\tau$-\textbf{\textit{nearest neighbours}}.
MFDMA$\tau$ is relatively immune to additive noise and non-stationarity, including the non-stationarity due to inclusions into the time series of events of a different dynamics.

The presence of \textbf{\textit{large-amplitude fluctuations}} in flux on a wide range of scales and the occurrence of many large abrupt jumps in flux are two interesting features of Kepler-30 time series. As shown in Figs.~\ref{figFirst1} and \ref{figFirst2}, the multiscale fluctuations in flux can be described by the increments $\Delta x(t,\tau)=x(t+\tau)-x(t)$, where $\tau$ varies from 29.4 min (Kepler cadence) to $\sim$60 days, going through the 22-day period (spot timescale) \textcolor{red}{with a step of 2 days}.
